Python Tutor Data Analysis Project
Post 1 - Raw Data Analysis
=============

For the initial stage of the analysis project for the Python Tutor data we went and did some basic
statistical analysis of the raw data. In addition we were able to come up with some statistics
on the types of compiler errors in the submitted code.

In order to do this cleanly, we made use of a product called GraphLab, which can be found at www.graphlab.com. This
software package has a very clean Python API, and can read data directly from JSON. This gave us a very clean, and quick
way to get right to doing analysis on the data.

Data
=============

- How the JSON is constructed (examples)

Basic Statistics
=============

- How did we get the statistics

- How many IP's (and how many submissions for each?)
- distribution of versions

Error Statistics
=============

- How did we get the errors (python code samples)

- actual statistics found (split up into both Python versions)
