Python Tutor Data Analysis Project
=============

Python Tutor is a free web based tool created by Phillip Guo located here http://pythontutor.com/. This tool allows a Python Programmer to obtain a visualization of their Python code, and the ability to step through each line to view Python's internal object structure as the code is executed.

The interesting part that we'll be looking at in this project is the fact that this program stores the code a user executes, allowing us at the backend to do some analysis of the code users submit.

For instance each submission to the site is timestamped and ipaddress logged, allowing us to view a history of each users code submissions.
